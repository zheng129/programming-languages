Notes and Materials for a Course on Programming Languages

Spoiler Alert: For now, I don't recommend reading the notes ahead of the lecture as I am planning to develop the material together in class, so it can be more fun and more interesting if you don't yet know the answers to the questions I am going to ask in class. 

Below are linked the files containing the material covered already. I expect you to have read and reviewed this material before the next lecture. If anything is unclear, let me know and I am happy to add material.

Remark: An interesting discussion on the relationship between programming languages in industry and research can be found in [Martin Berger's post](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/24884/use-of-process-calculi-and-pl-theory-for-modern-programming-language-development) at stack exchange. To quote "cutting edge theory does not address the concerns of current programming languages. It is about future languages. It will take a while for the 'real world' to catch up. The knowledge you use to build languages for today is the programming language theory of the past." As this is an introductory course to programming languages I will concentrate mostly on such well established theory of the past up to say, very roughly, 1995. I hope that at the end of the course you will agree that this theory is useful for real world programmers now.

We will touch on many topics that are treated in much greater depth in the first two volumes of the series of online textbooks on [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/index.html), which I recommend for further reading. A related course is [Programming Language Foundations in Agda
](https://plfa.github.io/Preface/). Other references will be added to the lectures.

Remark on references: There are a number of references to Wikipedia articles in the notes. These are considered pointers for further reading, but should not be taken as authorative references. They do not cover material that is part of this course, but rather hint at topics related to the course that are worth pursuing.  It is important to know what Wikipedia says, but one should not rely on it as a definitive source of information.
