Notes and Materials for a Course on Programming Languages

Thanks to Paula Severi and Samuel Balco for providing some of the material;  to Peter Jipsen, Drew Moshier and Fer-Jan de Vries for many helpful comments and discussions; to the students for continuing challenge and feedback; to all my colleagues who have been teaching me over all these years.

Remark: An interesting discussion on the relationship between programming languages in industry and research can be found in [Martin Berger's post](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/24884/use-of-process-calculi-and-pl-theory-for-modern-programming-language-development) at stack exchange. To quote "cutting edge theory does not address the concerns of current programming languages. It is about future languages. It will take a while for the 'real world' to catch up. The knowledge you use to build languages for today is the programming language theory of the past." As this is an introductory course to programming languages I will concentrate mostly on such well established theory of the past up to say, very roughly, 1995. I hope that at the end of the course you will agree that this theory is useful for real world programmers now.

We will touch on many topics that are treated in much greater depth in the first two volumes of the series of online textbooks on [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/index.html), which I recommend for further reading. A related course is [Programming Language Foundations in Agda
](https://plfa.github.io/Preface/). Other references will be added to the lectures.

Remark on references: There are a number of references to Wikipedia articles in the notes. These are considered pointers for further reading, but should not be taken as authorative references. They do not cover material that is part of this course, but rather hint at topics related to the course that are worth pursuing.  It can be important to know what Wikipedia says, but one should not rely on it as a definitive source of information.
